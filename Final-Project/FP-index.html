			<!-- Add description of Nola -->
			<p>Nola is a mixed bread dog. I personally like to think she is a mix of a German Shepard and a Corgi, although she does give me basset hound eyes sometimes.</p>
			<P>Nola came to us on October 17, 2022. She was found in roaming around the streets in poor shape, skinny and flea ridden. With the idea of fostering her in mind inorder to find her a forever home, we took her in and ensured she felt loved. Right away she got alone with Mika, our dog, and what can we say... we fell in love with her.</P>
			<p>Nola has now found a forever home and we are happy that she will be with us forever as well.</p>
